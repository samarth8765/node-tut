# Nodejs

## What is nodejs?
- Earlier, JS is limited to browsers only.
- So, developers created nodejs so that we can use JS out of browsers. Now we can run JS on servers.

# Uniform in URL
- The term "uniform" in a URL refers to the standardized format that is used to locate resources on the internet, which allows anyone to easily find and access those resources using a web browser.

- For example, consider the following two URLs:
 
    - http://example.com/images/logo.png
    - http://another-website.com/images/logo.png

-Both of these URLs point to an image file called "logo.png" that is located in an "images" folder. Even though the two URLs are for different websites and servers, they both use the same basic structure and follow the same conventions for specifying the protocol, domain name, and path to the resource. This means that anyone who knows how to read and interpret a URL can easily find and access the resource, regardless of where it is located.

- Globals in nodejs
    - Some common global variables in nodejs - 
    - __dirname - path to current directory.
    - __filename - file name.
    - require - function to use modules.
    - module - info about current module.
    - process - info about env where program is being executed.
